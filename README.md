# JavaPlaywrightWebDriver

## Overview

The **Java Playwright WebDriver Cucumber Quick Start Template** is a comprehensive starting point for building end-to-end test automation projects using Java, Playwright, Cucumber, JUnit 5, and enhanced reporting support from Allure and Cucumber Reports. This template empowers QA engineers and developers to quickly set up a robust testing framework and focus on creating efficient, maintainable, and readable test scenarios.

## Features

- **Java:** Harness the power of Java to create robust and maintainable test scripts.
- **Playwright:** Leverage Playwright's multi-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) for seamless cross-browser testing.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber:** Write human-readable scenarios using Cucumber's Gherkin language, fostering collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.
- **JUnit5 Test Execution:** Employ JUnit5 for test execution, offering robust test lifecycle management, reporting, and smooth integration with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Allure Report:** Generate interactive and visually appealing test reports using Allure for better insights into test execution.
- **Cucumber Reports:** Enhance your reporting capabilities with Cucumber Reports for detailed feature and scenario-level reports.
- **Page Object Model (POM) Design:** Implement the Page Object Model pattern for maintainable test scripts by separating page-specific interactions from test logic.
- **Configurable and Extensible:** The template ensures flexibility, allowing easy configuration customization, addition of dependencies, and framework extension as per project needs.
- **Sample Test Scenarios:** The template includes sample test scenarios showcasing web element interactions, common actions, and expected behavior validation.
- **Quick Start:** Get up and running in no time with a project structure, sample tests, and configuration files preconfigured.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to quickly set up your test automation project using this template:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using `mvn clean install`.

3. **Write Scenarios:** Create your feature files using Gherkin syntax in the `src/test/resources/features` directory.

4. **Write Step Definitions:** Implement the step definitions corresponding to your scenarios in the `src/test/java/stepdefinitions` directory.

5. **Run Tests:** Execute your tests using `mvn test`. Tests will run in your specified browsers and generate reports.

6. **View Reports:** After the test execution, find the generated Allure and Cucumber Reports in the `target` directory.
