# JavaPlaywrightWebDriver

## Overview

The JavaPlaywrightWebDriver project is a quick start template designed to provide a strong foundation for building web automation tests using Java programming language, Playwright for browser automation, Cucumber for behavior-driven development, and JUnit5 for test execution and reporting. This template streamlines the setup process for creating and executing automated tests for web applications, combining the power of these technologies.

## Features

- **Java Playwright Integration:** Utilize Playwright to automate interactions with web browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, using the Java programming language.

- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber:** Write human-readable scenarios using Cucumber's Gherkin language, fostering collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.

- **JUnit5 Test Execution:** Employ JUnit5 for test execution, offering robust test lifecycle management, reporting, and smooth integration with CI/CD pipelines.

- **Page Object Model (POM) Design:** Implement the Page Object Model pattern for maintainable test scripts by separating page-specific interactions from test logic.

- **Configurable and Extensible:** The template ensures flexibility, allowing easy configuration customization, addition of dependencies, and framework extension as per project needs.

- **Sample Test Scenarios:** The template includes sample test scenarios showcasing web element interactions, common actions, and expected behavior validation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Install required dependencies listed in the `pom.xml` file.
3. Create feature files using Cucumber Gherkin syntax under `src/test/resources/features` directory.
4. Implement step definitions for scenarios in the `src/test/java/stepdefinitions` package.
5. Organize page objects under `src/test/java/pages` package to encapsulate web element interactions.
6. Run tests using JUnit test runners.
7. Review test reports and logs generated in the `target` directory after test execution.

## Usage Examples

Example feature file (`src/test/resources/features/search.feature`):

****gherkin****
Feature: Search functionality on the website

  Scenario: User searches for a product
    Given the user is on the homepage
    When the user searches for "Playwright Automation"
    Then search results for the product are displayed
    And the user can see relevant products

Example step definition (`src/test/java/stepdefinitions/SearchStepDefs.java`):

import io.cucumber.java.en.*;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import pages.HomePage;
import pages.SearchResultsPage;

public class SearchStepDefs {

    private HomePage homePage = new HomePage();
    private SearchResultsPage searchResultsPage = new SearchResultsPage();

    @Given("the user is on the homepage")
    public void userIsOnHomepage() {
        homePage.navigate();
    }

    @When("the user searches for {string}")
    public void userSearchesForProduct(String productName) {
        homePage.search(productName);
    }

    @Then("search results for the product are displayed")
    public void searchResultsAreDisplayed() {
        Assertions.assertTrue(searchResultsPage.areSearchResultsDisplayed());
    }

    @Then("the user can see relevant products")
    public void userSeesRelevantProducts() {
        Assertions.assertTrue(searchResultsPage.hasRelevantProducts());
    }
}
